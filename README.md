## Overview

An all new design of an Interactive Card Detail Form, which has javascript authentication for inputs from the user.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started with mobile design first before going into wider screen.
I made a choice by using flex instead of grid.
taking my js bit by bit to get the functionality working

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Learnt the benefits of the Relative and Absoulate behaviors of forms and also knowing which approach is suitable for the design.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I would love to add a secured payment route for this project to enable users carry out that.

### Useful resources
